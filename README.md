# fmri-functional-connectivity

This repository contains Jupyter notebook: `functional_connectivity+prediction.ipynb`.
 `functional_connectivity+prediction.ipynb` followes the tutorial from [NI-edu](https://nilearn.github.io/dev/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.html) and resting-state fMRI data from [Natural Scenes Dataset](https://naturalscenesdataset.org/).

Below is a brief summary of it's content: 

### `functional_connectivity+prediction.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on functional connectivity and prediction tasks in fMRI data analysis:
- **Functional Connectivity**: Explores methods to compute connectivity between brain regions using correlation matrices.
- **Feature Extraction**: Demonstrates how to extract features from connectivity matrices for machine learning tasks.
- **Prediction Models**: Implements predictive models (e.g., regression or classification) to analyze relationships between brain connectivity and behavioral or clinical outcomes.
- **Evaluation**: Provides techniques for evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

These notebooks serve as a practical guide for fMRI data analysis, combining theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation.
